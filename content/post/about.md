I am a fifth year PhD candidate at the University of Pittsburgh Department of Biomedical Informatics.

I tweet a lot about informatics and research! 

I love everything to do with biomedical informatics, machine learning, data visualization, and manipulating rich datasets.

I have earned a MHI (Master of Health Informatics) and MPH (Master of Public Health) in Epidemiology with a certificate in public health genetics from University of Michigan and a Bachelor of Science in Biological Engineering from Cornell University. During my time in Ann Arbor, I have done some research with genetic datasets, HPV, cancer, and mathematical models.

My future will hopefully be in academia.

Apart from my intellectual pursuits, I am deeply passionate about community engagement on various public health issues, particularly issues surrounding sexual health. In my spare time, I play the violin, drink bubble tea, and go on long scenic bike rides.
